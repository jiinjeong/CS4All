        <h3>Part 1: Bold, Italics, and Highlight</h3>
        <p>We can make this paragraph text <strong>bold</strong>, or <em>italisized</em>, or <mark>highlighted</mark>.</p>
        <h4>We can make a heading <em>italisized</em> or <mark>highlighted</mark>, but it is already <strong>bold</strong>.</h4>
        <p><strong><em><mark>We can even make a text that is bold, italisized, AND highlighted.</mark></em></strong></p>

        <h3>Part 2: Preformatted Text</h3>
        <pre>Preformatted text appears on your webpage
        almost exactly as it does in your
        HTML document.</pre>
        <p>This means that it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>appears in the computer-esque font <pre>Monospace.</pre></li>
            <li><pre>preserves      indents,
            line breaks,
            and extra   spaces.</pre></li>
            <li><pre>will go off the screen if you let it go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on...</pre>
                <ul><li>A scroll bar will appear at the bottom of the page so that you can see any text that extends off of the screen.</li></ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        
        <p>To make a paragraph text preformatted:</p>
        <pre>use only "pre" tags, no "p" tags.</pre>
        <br>
        <p>However, you can nest a pre tag inside of a...</p>
        <h4><pre>heading or</pre></h4>
        <blockquote><pre>blockquote.</pre></blockquote>
        <br>
        <blockquote>When you open a pre tag, the text will <pre>always go onto a new line on the webpage.</pre></blockquote>
        <hr>
        
        <h3>Part 3 (Optional): Smaller, Subscript, and Superscript</h3>
        <p>We can <small>reduce the font size</small> of text.</p>
        <p>We can also make text <sub>subscripted</sub> or <sup>superscripted</sup>.</p>
        <p>This is useful for equations.<br>For example: k<sub>1</sub> = 10<sup>2</sup> = 100</p>
