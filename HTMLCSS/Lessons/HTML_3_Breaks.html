        <h1>Breaks</h1>
        <br>
        
        <p>Here is an example of two separate headings:</p>
        <h3>One Heading</h3>
        <h3>A Separate Heading</h3>
        <p>Notice the space between them.</p>
        <br>
        
        <p>Here is an example of two separate headings with a break between them:</p>
        <h3>One Heading</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>A Separate Heading After a Break</h3>
        <p>Notice the larger space between them. You can write multiple, consecutive breaks to create an even larger space.</p>
        <br>
        
        <p>Here is an example of a single headings with a break within it:</p>
        <h3>This Is All a<br>Single Heading</h3>
        <p>Notice that there is no space between the two lines of the heading.</p>
        <br><br>
        
        <p>To review from last lesson, if you place a space (by pressing enter) in between or within lines of code, it does not affect the webpage. For example:</p>
        
        
        
        <h4>In the code, this paragraph has three space before it, and right here,
            it goes onto a new line.</h4>
