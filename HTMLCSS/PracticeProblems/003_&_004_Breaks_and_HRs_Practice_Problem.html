        <h2>Practice Problem: Breaks and Horizontal Rules</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Create an acrostic poem of your name, including both your first name and last name.</h3>
        <blockquote>Note: If you prefer, you can chose a phrase other than your name, but it should be at least two words long.</blockquote>
        <br>
        <p>First, create a paragraph containing your first name in all capital letters, and a separate paragraph containing your last name in all capital letters.</p>
        <p>Second, add a break between the two paragraphs to increase the space between them.</p>
        <p>Third, add a break between letters of your name so that each letter is on a separate line.</p>
        <p>Fourth, after each letter, add a word that begins with that letter and describes yourself.</p>
        <p>Fifth, add a heading at the top of the page, and give your poem a title.</p>
        <p>Finally, add a horizontal rule between the title and the poem.</p>
